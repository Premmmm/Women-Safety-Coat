# Women-Safety-Coat

## About
This project was done with consern for the safety of INDIAN women in mind. There is an camera and a PIR sensor setup at the back of the trench coat.
With the help of the mobile app the woman can toggle Lone Mode and Crowd Mode. When Lone Mode is toggled, the PIR sensor checks for any anonymous person behind, 
if anyone is behind the camera turns on and captures the face this done with OpenCV. In case if the anonymous guy touches the women, the coat is covered with
copper tape which is connected to a supercharged capasitor, the woman will have a toggle switch under her sleve she can turn it on to make the circuit go live.
We also made a 3D printed heel which has a PiezoElectric sensor, which when tapped with a certain pattern sends a broadcast alert message with the current location
to her parents.
